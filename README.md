# Shiny! Shiny!

##Overview

Shiny! Shiny! is a very simple text authoring app for Chrome. It is designed around the '[Ace](https://ace.c9.io)' editor. It is ideal for use in educational environments (e.g. Exams) where a full screen text editor is required, without the distraction of a web-browser (when used in 'kiosk' mode).

It has a number of simple features (saving, opening, printing) that are detailed in the [INSTRUCTIONS](documentation/INSTRUCTIONS.md) file (available from the App by pressing '__CTRL-?__').

International and 'special' characters are supported by their 'Unicode' codes. Full details and the codes can be found in the [CHARACTERS](documentation/CHARACTERS.md) file (available from the App by pressing '__CTRL-SHIFT-?__').

##Usage

You can download the code yourself for modification/testing/usage/debugging or grab it from the [Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shiny-shiny/ihigondjldgbcfcaabmplodljjliedaf).

##Naming

Ironically named for it's minimalistic approach. Sometimes __simple solutions__ are best.
