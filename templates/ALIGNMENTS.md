[align-justify--]
This is a much longer paragraph of text, which is required in order to show how a fully justified set of sentences will actually look. As the final sentence of a paragraph is not normally justified, just a single line or paragraph would not work properly. As a result, we need to have much more text in order to see the desired output!
